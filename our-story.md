# Welcome
This documentation details the upgrade of the USSF portal managed by the ORBIT team. This is meant to be the home for all engineering, research and design, and product related information on the project, our findings, as well as decisions we've made along the way and what influenced them.

## Background
As a new branch of the United States Armed Services, the Space Force presents a unique
opportunity to build out robust, secure, user-centered services using agile methodologies. We
want to ensure space professionals are able to receive information and resources in a timely,
efficient, and accessible manner. Simultaneously, we want to ensure that the system that supports these users is scalable and can accommodate the needs of a burgeoning branch of the Department of the Air Force. We will aim to develop and centralize the Space Force portal in a manner that provides scalable and secure cloud-based infrastructure, clear user management, secure data storage and user-friendly content management. The solution we propose aims to position the Space Force portal as a modern solution that reflects the ease with which customers in the private sector use technology, and that can grow alongside the Space Force.

## The problem weâ€™re solving & our envisioned solution
Military service portals have historically provided access to Service-specific news, resources, and other sites or applications required for military life and job roles. The general goal of any military service portal is to quickly locate and access policies, procedures and support, among other documentation. 

However, as our research has shown with the Air Force service portal, the current deluge of information and disparate sites by which service members must piece together relevant and timely information tend to offer more hindrance than help. As the Space Force is being stood up as the newest branch of the military, our team's objective is to create a single venue for Space Force personnel to use as a window into their full career and a seamless doorway through which they can access the vital sites and services they need. In addition, given all of their daily activities in balancing military life, job role, and personal life, we believe that by providing accurate reminders and cues to action on military requirements such as PT tests and immunizations, that we can offer an opportunity to have to remember a few less things.
