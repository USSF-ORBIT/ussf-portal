# Design elements

The new Space Force portal was created with users in mind — the team that built the Portal interviewed dozens of Guardians to understand their preferences and needs regarding content and layout. Just as talking to actual users helps teams create better products and services, so does maintaining consistency within a given product or service. Consistent design patterns help users more quickly learn how to interact with a digital product and also help build (and maintain) users’ trust. One time-tested way to achieve this consistency is by using a design system. A design system is a toolkit of principles, guidance, and code that makes it easier to build accessible, mobile-friendly government websites. 

A government design system helps users know what to expect when they visit federal websites; likewise, the Space Force design system gives users a sense of what to expect when they visit the Space Force portal. All design systems allow you to provide consistent usability, accessibility, editorial style, and look-and-feel across your websites and digital services. This consistency delivers a more seamless, user-friendly experience (a key requirement of 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (21st Century IDEA) [digital.gov]) and also increases trust in government.

A comprehensive design system allows a team to spend less time building from scratch and more time focused on solving strategic problems. Our SFDS will speed up the development processes and help teams across Space Force concentrate on higher-level goals and outcomes. Relatedly, design systems help your product or service benefit from continuous improvement. Each improvement to the design system improves all design system sites because each of those sites is created using the same code and components.

#### Design experience principles

They define and communicate the key characteristics of the product to a wide variety of stakeholders including clients, colleagues, and team members. Design principles articulate the fundamental goals that all decisions can be measured against and thereby keep the pieces of a project moving toward an integrated whole. They provide a consistent vision of the project for the project team.

*The USSF/CTIO + Truss.works experience principles in relation to the Space Force service portal are listed below:*

TRANSPARENCY
We believe that this principle is fundamentally linked to fairness and trust, in whatever manner it manifests. A transparent approach is about being clear, open and honest with Guardians within the design and ensuring that communication is easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language be used, in every aspect throughout the service portal.

RELEVANCY
Content and context will always be relevant to Guardians. We will be mindful to keep our content concise, timely and pertinent to Guardians at the time it is published. We will retire content as it gets stale.

COLLABORATION & FLEXIBILITY
At all times we will strive to make Guardian’s experience on the service portal individualized to them. The experience will be flexible so that Guardians can customize the portal to their needs and interests. We will strive as much as we’re able to take a collaborative approach in building the service portal, because we know that sharing information, insights, strategies and resources across silos of units or departments, ultimately leads to increased efficiency and impact.

LEAD THE WAY
Guardians deserve our best effort to create, develop, and iterate on the sites and services they rely upon every day. We strive every day to improve how we are building out services for Space Force personnel and will model new thinking and approaches to building software that are reflective of the standards within the Guardian Ideal. 

FOCUS ON SIMPLICITY AND VALUE
We value successful outcomes over fashion and design trends, and will use aesthetics to only support proven usability and to enhance functionality. We strive to consider the user's goal at all times and to provide the simplest solution to achieve that goal, not the more complex (and often easier) one.
