# Feature-specific e2e tests

## Context and Problem Statement

End-to-end testing is used to test that an application behaves as expected from the perspective of the user. The current state of our e2e tests is a mix of feature-specific tests, and tests that could be described as page-specific. Page-specific meaning, there is a test file for each page that is in the portal client, and some pages within the CMS dashboard. A lot of these page-specific assertions are already being covered with our unit tests, so there exists a fair amount of redundancy. We would also like to test some features that require interaction with both the CMS and the portal client, so placing a test like that in a CMS folder or a portal client folder just makes things more confusing. There is also a lot of unnecessary complexity in some of these test files that chain together tests, causing test results to largely depend on the results of a prior test.

## Decision Drivers

- It's often difficult to know exactly where a new test should go
- A lot of existing tests rely on past actions/results from a test that comes before, which leads to more flakeyness and unnecessary complexity
- Having isolated, feature-specific tests will make it easier to use parallel test execution in Playwright, greatly reducing the execution time of tests

## Considered Options

- Do nothing, keep tests as they are, segmented tests that are specific to both the CMS and portal client
- Make tests feature-specific

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Make tests feature-specific", because this will not only reduce the execution time of our tests, it will also reduce complexity, making it easier and faster to create new tests.

### Positive Consequences

- Less complexity around creating new tests
- Less mental overhead maintaining tests
- Further reduce test flakeyness by having more isolated tests
- Reduce test execution time

### Negative Consequences

- A lot of upfront work to break apart current test files

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Do nothing, keep tests as they are, segmented tests that are specific to both the CMS and portal client

- Good, because we won't have to do break apart large test files
- Bad, because we will continue to have flakey, and overly complex tests
- Bad, because test execution time in CI likely continue to increase
- Bad, because there will continue to be confusion around where to place a new test

### Make tests feature-specific

- Good, because it makes it easier to create new tests
- Good, because isolated tests execute faster
- Good, because smaller test files leads to less comlexity
- Good, because smaller tests are easier to maintain
- Bad, because a lot of upfront work is needed to break apart and refactor current test files
