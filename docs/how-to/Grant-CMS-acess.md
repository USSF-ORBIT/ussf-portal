# Adding new users to the CMS staging environment

#### 1. Login to Staging as a CMS admin. Check to make sure they don’t already have access.

#### 2. Gather the information required for step 3:

  - User’s DOD ID
  - User’s first & last name
  - Users must login to https://staging.my.spaceforce.mil/login. The login info won't show up right away in SAML so it is best to do this in advance.


#### 3. Get user SAML access & assign a role in the CMS

### 4. Once the above chore is completed & the SAML group is assigned have the user login into the the CMS https://staging.cms.spaceforce.mil/
Once they’ve accessed the CMS, they will be visible in the CMS & a CMS admin can assign roles as needed.
