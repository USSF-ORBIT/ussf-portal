###### Noah

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noah has been working in the weird world of government technology for 13 years where he’s done everything from Red Teaming to infrastructure buildouts to system transitions and modernizations. He came to work with the Space Force in 2019 as the service stood up in order to help solve some of the tough technical issues they are facing as a new branch of the military and it’s been a wild ride. Noah is passionate about making sure humans aren’t forgotten when organizations want new processes, policies or products.

###### Kat

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kat is a design operations aficionado who arrived at USSF from the United States Digital Service and decided to stay for a while, mostly because of Noah. Kat believes in well executed service design, always taking a human centered approach, working with great people and defining hard problems before you try to solve them.

###### Abigail

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abigail is a San Francisco-based software engineer with a background in tech startups, ecommerce, advertising, and publishing. Before joining Truss, she was lead engineer for the web A/B testing team at Sephora. In addition to contributing to the technical success of the team, she helped build a safe, supportive culture focused on empathy, honesty, and teamwork.

###### Barry

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barry grew up in the rural parts of South Central Kansas and Southeast Colorado. Self taught by way of extended family members throwing away their old broken computers and a stubbornness to get a sound card and a modem working in Mandrake Linux. Their first “real” job was desktop support for a local non-profit healthcare provider in Southeast Colorado. After awhile, an opportunity to move to California to play with Active Directory, enterprise storage and VMWare virtualization presented itself. Driven to get professional Linux experience on their resume, they did the Silicone Valley startup, cloud, DevOps thing and landed at a high-growth SaaS deploying thousands of servers around the world.

###### John

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John launched his career in product management during the first dot-com boom, and has weathered the ups and downs of the tech industry working for both startups and public corporations in the digital media, entertainment, and consumer editorial spaces. As an experienced product manager overseeing many projects and leading the product roadmap and vision, he enjoys fostering seamless communication between design, development, and executive teams in an effort to create the most exceptional digital products and services. When he isn't working, you'll find John record shopping with his wife and daughter and "attempting" to make wine.

###### Kate

Before becoming a Trussel, she created online coursework for an art school, led writer-focused editorial and education initiatives at a startup, and was the first content strategist at 18F, where she helped build out the content team, founded the Writing Lab, and worked with many excellent government partner organizations. Kate’s work is driven by user need and the beauty of precise, lyrical language (before entering the UX world, Kate earned her MFA in fiction writing). Her goal on each project is to wholly engage the user to effect positive change.
